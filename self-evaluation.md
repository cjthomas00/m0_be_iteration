# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method? 
    I understand what the `.each` method does and it makes sense to me. Finding how to print certain things after that has been where I've struggled.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

I had some productive struggle with the lesson. It was good to have to use the ruby doc to find the answers to some of the questions. The unproductive struggle came with the second challenge of the each.rb doc. 

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I need to get more comfortable finding methods in the ruby doc. 

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

How do you guys know which method to use to accomplish a certain task? Can you use more than one method to accomplish the same task? I plan on posing those questions to my small group.
